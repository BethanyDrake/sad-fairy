No one to care if he shoed the spiders back outside. Even if he grew to the size of a person and cleaned the house for real, or fixed the leaky drain pipe, or turned the heater on in winter, there would be no one to care. For a while, he had done all those things, hoping the family would come back. But they never did. So Gurag let the dust build up. He let the spiders in. He let the roof leak, and let the rooms get cold even in summer. And then, when Gurag had long ago given up waiting, a car drove into the driveway. Footsteps approached. A key jiggled in the rusty lock. The door opened, letting in damp autumn air, and Gurag had a purpose once again.

Nadine arrived at her new home with a rent-a-van full of boxes and a stress headache. It had taken all morning to get all her stuff loaded, followed by several hours of driving an unfamiliar vehical. She wasn't proud of some of the stuff she'd yelled at other drivers on the way here. Although she thought "cyst fucking shitbox" deserved points for creatity, at least. She just needed to get inside, figure out which box the instant coffee and kettle were packed in, and get her caffeine back up. 

The front garden was massively over grown, but it had a lot more character than the sterile front lawns to the left and right. The house itself was pretty nice, if a little run down. Yes, the paint was flaking off the wall, and yeah, the iron fillagry lining the front steps looked a little less high end covered in moss and birdshit, but it was a proper house, with wide windows, and even a chimney. Most importantly, it was dirt cheap, and a thousand times better than the shoeboxes she could afford to rent in the city. It was just a shame she was moving in alone. 

As explained in the email from the landlord, Nadine found the key under the old fairy statuette by the door. One of its little stone wings had in a chip in it, but a determined expression was still clearly visible under the grime. 

"Thanks for keeping that safe for me," Nadine murmered, taking the key and wiping the dirt off on her jeans. The first day of living alone was early to be talking to inanimate objects, but she

She let herself in, shoving the stiff door with her shoulder to get it to actually open. Inside was just as spacious as the pictures in the listing, high ceileings, wide streatches of hardwood flaws, fully furnished. She took a deep breath of musty air, and felt the tension in her jaw loosen.
