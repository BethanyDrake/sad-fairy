- short snippets from the fairy's perspective. 

- Move into new house. Wierd helpful things begin to happen. her yoghurt turns back into milk. 

- While having an argument on the phone, something goes very wrong, and she calls the landlord. He's pretty grumpy, but reluctanly fixes the thing. 

- The next time something goes wrong, he's even more annoyed, and she's even more freaked out. He lightens up slightly to reassure her, but then the door won't open, he can't get out. He gets angry, and then things start really going wrong. They figure out it doesn't like raised voices, go quietly to the door, gently break it down, and get out. She goes and stays with a friend for the night. 

- They come back together, and things are eerily pleasant. The kettle is freshly boiled, there are nice smells. They search the place, but can't find any trace of squatterss. He goes about fixing the door, and she goes about packing. 

- after a while, they find a message written in mould stains. "Don't leaf." She tries to open the door again. They're scared, but try to stay calm. The fairy appears, and begs them not to be angry. Says he wants to help, and they can stay. They agree to stay for one night, and "try" although they're not exactly sure what they're trying to do, just not be angry. 

- they stay. Problems: no food. They cook instant noodles for lunch, and set another pack aside for dinner. He tries to help her pack up her things, calling it "organising", but things start going wrong pretty quickly and they give up on that idea. She brings out a game of cards, and he opens up about his father's gambling. She gets annoyed at him blaming his father -- if his mother knew he was a gambler before hand, then it was her fault, not his. of course, when they argue, the lights exlpode. So, in the dark, she admits that her own marriage broke up because her fiance decided he didn't like something about her. Not gambling maybe, just overspending.
